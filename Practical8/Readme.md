## Week 8 Practical 

In  this week , we performed GCD in two ways.
The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two or more numbers is the greatest common factor number that divides them, exactly. It is also called the highest common factor (HCF).

## Exercise 1 - User inputs

We perfomed GCD by taking two inputs from the user for a and b.

## Exercise 2 - Randomized inputs

We performed randomized inputs by using srand and rand().
