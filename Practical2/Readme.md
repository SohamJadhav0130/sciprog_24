This is for practical 2 of week 2

- First program is to convert the decimal values into binary values in C
- The second program is to add the whole series of numbers and then print it out as a sum and then check the difference when the series is reversed.

Outputs of both programs:

- conversion.exe

PS D:\Study\ICHEC\sciprog_24\Practical2> .\conversion.exe
The number of digits is 26
inum=33554431,  fnum=33554432.000000, inum in binary=1111111111111111111111111

- sum.exe

PS D:\Study\ICHEC\sciprog_24\Practical2> .\sum.exe       
 Sum1=7.485478
 Sum2=7.485472
 Difference between the two is 0.000007
