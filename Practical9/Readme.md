# Practical 9

This is the 9th practical of ICHEC, in this week we are doing the following:

This code checks if a matrix is a "magic square." A magic square is a matrix where the sum of all rows, all columns, and both diagonals are equal to a specific value called the magic constant (M).

The formula for the magic constant M is:
         M = n Ã— ( n^ 2 + 1 ) / 2 

 Program Details:

    main_stub.c:
        This program reads a matrix from a file and dynamically allocates memory for it.
        It uses a function from the magic_square.h file to check if the matrix is a magic square.
        After the check, it frees the memory and closes the file.

    magic_square.h:
        Contains a function called ismagicsquare.
        This function verifies if the input matrix satisfies the conditions of a magic square. It ensures that the sums of all rows, columns, and both diagonals are equal to MM.

    Input Files:
        magic_square.txt: Contains a matrix that fulfills the magic square conditions.
        not_magic_square.txt: Contains a matrix that does not fulfill the conditions.

This exercise demonstrates dynamic memory allocation, file handling, and mathematical validation of matrices in C.
